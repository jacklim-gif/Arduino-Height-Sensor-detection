Arduino Height Sensor
This project uses an Arduino to measure and display height using an ultrasonic sensor. The sensor detects distance and converts it into height values, which can be displayed on a serial monitor or LCD screen.

Features:
Measures height in centimeters.
Uses ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04).
Simple and low-cost setup.
Beginner-friendly Arduino project.

Hardware Used:
Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
Jumper wires, breadboard
Optional: LCD display (16x2)
